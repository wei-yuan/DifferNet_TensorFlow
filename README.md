# DifferNet_TensorFlow
## About this project
It's a reimplementation of github project differtnet by TensorFlow.

GitHub: [differnet](https://github.com/marco-rudolph/differnet)
Paper: [Same Same But DifferNet: Semi-Supervised Defect Detection with Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12577) by Marco Rudolph, Bastian Wandt and Bodo Rosenhahn

## Tensor
The default Tensor ordering is listing as the following

Abbreviation
N: batch number, C: Channel, H: Height, W: Width

PyTorch prefer NCHW 
see [Why does pytorch prefer using NCHW?](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/why-does-pytorch-prefer-using-nchw/83637)

TensorFlow prefer NHWC
